Tons of people have recommended buying merino wool clothes for travel. They smell less, breathable, moisture-wicking and can last longer without wash. Problem is, they cost a fortune. A single t-shirt usually cost $50! I cannot justify spending that much for a one t-shirt at the moment. So, I went with one of the cheapest merino wool clothes that I could find, which are socks. A pair of merino wool socks can usually be had for about $20, which is still a little steep, but I went ahead and bought one. I got a [Darn Tough](https://darntough.com/) Micro Crew Cushion while they were on sale, aaaand they were kinda a disappointment.

I've been using basic Uniqlo socks for 3 years prior to this. They were cheap, light, and thin. Perhaps a little too thin, as several of them have holes due to friction from putting on and taking off shoes. I decided to go with Darn Tough socks because of the lifetime guarantee, whereby if your socks get a hole, they will replace it for free. Sounds great, especially after having my socks develop holes. And so when it arrived I was excited to try them. It was a cold winter day, and my thin Uniqlo socks definitely didn't help keep me warm. I quickly switched to the Darn Tough socks, and they were *cozy*. It felt like your pet giving you a hug on your foot. But that is basically the only good thing I could say about it. 

They were cozy, but it came at an expense. They were a bit *too* thick. My shoes immediately felt like they were a size smaller. They were also a very structured pair of socks, which contours the foot and makes it feel smaller in addition to the thickness. They feel comfortable at times, but mostly they just feel small. They were also very warm. It got me through the winter just fine, but I was told by people that merino wool socks would also be good for the summer. It's not. My feet were uncomfortable every day that I wore it during the summer. I mostly reverted to my Uniqlo socks to give my feet some breathing room for the summer. 

So is the Darn Tough Micro Crew Cushion the end all be all pair of socks to get? For me, these weren't it. I'm still going to keep it for use during winter, but for most of the time I'll go back to my good old Uniqlo socks. My search for the perfect pair of socks for travel continues.
